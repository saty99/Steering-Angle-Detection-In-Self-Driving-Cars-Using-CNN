## Demo
<img src="https://github.com/saty99/Self-Driving-Cars-Using-Keras/blob/master/Demo.gif"/>



## Dataset
- Approximately 45,500 images, 2.3GB. One of the original datasets made by [SullyChen](https://github.com/SullyChen/) in 2017. Data was recorded around Rancho Palos Verdes and San Pedro California.
- 25 minutes = 25{min} x 60{1 min = 60 sec} x 30{fps} = 45,000 images ~ 2.3 GB






## Description
- self_driving_using_keras.ipynb file contains 4 different Architectures trained on the data for 100 epochs and selected the 2 best models that converge loss faster.
- Best_Model_1.ipynb , Best_Model_2.ipynb contains the model trained for 1000 epochs.
- Best_Model_1 and Best_Model_2 files contains **CSV**,**Excel**,**Json** files of history object showing loss on epoch  1-1000. The Output **Model** is also saved in it.
-run_model_one and run_model_two are **Python** files for running the model on dataset.
